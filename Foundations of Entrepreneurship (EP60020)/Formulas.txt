Financial Statements:

	Gross profit = Sales – Cost of goods sold
	Cost of goods sold = Opening inventory + Purchase during the year – Closing Inventory
	Operating profit = Gross profit – Operating expenses
	Operating Expenses includes depriciation, ammortization, salary
	Profit Before Tax (PBT) = Operating profit – Interest expenses
	Net profit = Profit before tax – Income tax
	Retained profit = Net profit – dividend 
	EBITDA = Earnings (profit) before Interest, tax, depreciation & amortization.
		   = Operating Profit + Depreciation + Amortization

	Depreciation = (Procurement cost – Salvage value)/Useful life
	profit before tax = gross - operating profit - depreciation - interest
	surplus this year = profit after tax - dividend
	total surplus = previous surplus + this year surplus


Break Even Point(BEP) Analysis:
	P = Q*S-Q*V-F
	Q = (F+P)/(S-V)	{P=0 for zero profit}

		Profit P = Sales minus all the Costs 
		Costs: 
			Fixed (F: total per period) and Total Variable (V: per unit)xQ
		Selling Price = S; 
		Quantity Sold = Q; 
		Profit = P
		Sales = Q*S; 
		Total variable cost = Q*V; 
		Total Cost = Q*V + F 

	Contribution Margin = Selling price(S) – Unit variable cost(V)
	Contribution (total contribution) = Total sales – Total variable cost
	Margin of safety = Total Units sold - BEP


Degree of Operating Leverages(DOL) = (% change in EBIT) / (% change in sales)
							  = (sales - vaiable costs)/(sales - variable costs- fixed costs)


𝑫𝒆𝒈𝒓𝒆𝒆 𝒐𝒇 𝑭𝒊𝒏𝒂𝒏𝒄𝒊𝒂𝒍 𝑳𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒓𝒂𝒈𝒆(𝑫𝑭𝑳) = (𝑬𝑩𝑰𝑻)/(𝑬𝑩𝑰𝑻−𝑰𝒏𝒕𝒆𝒓𝒆𝒔𝒕)
	EBIT = Earnings before interest and taxes
	

#####################################  CASH FLOW #######################################

Indirect Method: Cash Flow from Operational Activities
	Total cash flow from operating activities =
		+ Net profit (known as Net Income in USA)
		+ Depreciation (This was deducted as expense. But no cash went out)
		+ Losses from sale of fixed assets, if any.
		— Gains from sale of fixed assets, if any.
		(Note that sales value of fixed assets will be included in in cash flow from investment activity)
		— Increase in current assets.
		+ Decrease in current assets.
		+ Increase in current liabilities
		— Decrease in current liabilities

Cash Flow from Investment Activities
	+ Capital expenditure
	+ Investment

Cash Flow from Financing Activities
	+ Net borrowing.
	— Net investment in equity or debt.
	— Dividend paid
	+ Fresh equity induction.
